# `checkenv` - Check Your Environment

A modern best-practice is to [store your application's configuration in environmental variables](http://12factor.net/config).  This allows you to keep all config data outside of your repository, and store it in a standard, system-agnotic location.  Modern build/deploy/development tools make it easier to manage these variables per-host, but they're still often undocumented, and can lead to bugs when missing.

This module lets you define all the environmental variables your application relies on in an `env.json` file.  It then provides a method to check for these variables at application launch, and print a help screen if any are missing.

## Installation

``` bash
$ npm i -S checkenv
```

## Usage

First, define a JSON file called `env.json` in your project root (see below).  Then, add the following line to the top of your project's entry file:

``` js
require('checkenv').check();
```

By default, `checkenv` will print a pretty error message and call `process.exit(1)` if any required variables are missing.  It will also print an error message if optional variables are missing, but will not exit the process.

If you would like to handle errors yourself, `check` takes an optional `pretty` argument which causes it to throw errors instead of printing an error message.  This will only result in an error being thrown on missing required variables.

``` js
try {
  require('checkenv').check(false);
} catch (e) {
  // Do something with this error
}
```

## Configuration

Your JSON file should define the environmental variables as keys, and either a boolean (required) as the value, or a configuration object with any of the options below.

### JSON
``` json
{
  "NODE_ENV": {
    "description": "This defines the current environment",
    "validators": [{
      "name": "in",
      "options": ["development", "testing", "staging", "production"]
    }]
  },
  "PORT": {
    "description": "This is the port the API server will run on",
    "default": 3000
  },
  "NODE_PATH": true,
  "DEBUG": {
    "required": false,
    "description": "If set, enables additional debug messages"
  }
}
```

### Options

#### `required`

Defines whether or not this variable is required.  By default, all variables are required, so you must explicitly set them to optional by setting this to `false`

#### `description`

Describes the variable and how it should be used. Useful for new developers setting up the project, and is printed in the error output if present.

#### `default`

Defines the default value to use if variable is unset. Implicitly sets `required` to `false`.

## Planed Enhancements

There is one major enhancements in the pipeline:

  1. Value validation (type, enum, regex)
